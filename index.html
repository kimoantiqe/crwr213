                                        For days now, I have been travelling all alone through the malevolent deserts of
                                        Egypt. I know what you are thinking. Is he stupid? How dumb can he be to be
                                        alone in a desert? I promise you, I don’t know how this happened. I was a part
                                        of a small expedition group that scoured the Saqaraa dessert looking for the
                                        "Vally of Kings." Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to visit Egypt. I fell
                                        in love with Egyptian history while watching the mummy cartoon on Nickelodeon.
                                        If you think Greek mythology is fascinating, just wait until you hear about the
                                        mythical Egyptian Pharoah gods. And what is better than experiencing it
                                        firsthand?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We were doing our thing, walking in a horizontal pattern, trying our best not to
                                        leave a spot unexplored. And suddenly, out of the blue, a sandstorm the size of
                                        the Empire State Building rushed towards our group. Our guide suddenly starts
                                        screaming in Arabic some words I didn’t understand. My first instinct is to run
                                        away and hide behind a stone. Oh boy, was I wrong!
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="audio-player" data-video="sqzZe6DholE" data-autoplay="0" data-loop="1"

                                    <p>
                                        I hold my breath, look around me for the nearest stone and start running as fast
                                        as I can. Stupid me, thinking that a mere stone could shield this mammoth of a
                                        storm. Minutes pass by and I slowly start to think I made it, but suddenly,
                                        everything turns pitch black.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        After what seemed to be a couple of hours, I wake up with the sun bleaching my
                                        body and the sand literally gnawing into my skin. I stand up and look around me,
                                        hoping to find my team.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I see no one. Literally no one.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I don’t know what to do. My body and mind are not ready for this. I start to
                                        panic and walk around in circles. Who knows, maybe God loves me today and I
                                        might come across a Bedouin tribe?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After walking a couple of hours, I stumbled upon a strange underground colossal
                                        structure. I knew it! I found a burial chamber! For a second, I forget about
                                        being stuck in a desert and just stand there, admiring the spectacular view. I
                                        tiptoe inside, making sure I don’t accidentally push or hit anything. Pharoah
                                        burial sites are well-known for having intricate death traps designed to deter
                                        intruders.

                                        tomb I have ever seen.

                                        Omar, the chief Egyptologist in the Ministry of Archeology, summoned his team of
                                        brilliant experts and ordered them to relocate Raa’s tomb to the Grand National
                                        Museum in Alexandria.
                                    </p>

                                        Everyone was thrilled and agreed with the decision. However, Sherif, the lead
                                        Egyptologist, was concerned. If you have ever met Sherif, you would know right
                                        away why he would do that. Sherif is the kind of guy who would avoid a black cat
                                        while going back home, never saunter under any stairs, and never come close to
                                        the number 13. He is probably the most superstitious man in Egypt.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He was nervous because of the monstrous stele that was found next to Raa’s
                                        magnificent tomb. The stele was full of dust, spider webs, mold, and blood
                                        markings. If you are not familiar with Egyptian mythology, blood markings are
                                        placed on cursed tombs. It is said that whoever touches these markings is
                                        doomed. Nonetheless, Sherif spent hours carefully doing his magic and was able
                                        to restore the stele to its glory days. Unfortunately, it wasn’t at all good
                                        news.

                                        sleep. Children of the Nile, if the lustrous sun stops shinning and I am not at
                                        my glorious home, I will destroy you and your dreams,” read the ancient stele.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Chief did not listen to Sherif’s concern and aggressively demanded a hasty
                                        transport and restoration. Reluctantly, Sherif complied and worked tirelessly
                                        for weeks to fulfil his demands. Little did he or any of his team know what was
                                        going to happen.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Egypt was beaming with happiness when news of the move was made public. Raa was
                                        the only missing king from the 3rd dynasty that saved Egypt from the Meroë’s
                                        invasion. So, you can probably tell he was one of their favorite war general
                                        pharaohs.

                                    <p>
                                        When the ministry noticed how ecstatic the Egyptians were, they decided to
                                        create a nationwide massive event where Raa’s body would visit every city. They
                                        called the event “The Golden Parade.”<br>
                                        Thousands of Egyptians took it to the street alongside hundreds of the countries
                                        musicians, and everyone was going crazy over Raa’s mummified body.

                                    <p>
                                        While everyone was celebrating, Sherif was stuck in his dark and gloomy Cairo
                                        apartment, trying to decode what, “If the lustrous sun stops shinning,” meant.
                                        “Sun stops shinning. Hmmm... Does Raa mean at night? But we moved his body weeks
                                        ago and we are all fine. Hmmm… Is this stele a lie?”
                                        “Oh God, don’t tell me…”
                                        “It’s talking about a solar eclipse.”

                                    </p>

                                        Sherif quickly googled when the next solar eclipse is. Surprisingly, it turns
                                        out to be in 12 days. He hastily opened his work laptop, typed out all his
                                        alarming conclusions, and sent it to everyone he knows.
                                        No one believed Sherif, but Sherif did not care. He started packing his stuff
                                        and looked for the cheapest flight out of Egypt.

                                        Egypt is slumbered with unexplained chaos. Could it be the curse of Raa? Or is
                                        it just pure unexpected coincidence? The president is running out of ideas.
                                        Someone in the ministry got hold of Sherif’s report and conveyed his findings to
                                        the president’s office. In just a couple of days, the ministry contacted Sherif
                                        and begged him to come back to Egypt. They needed his expertise to help end this
                                        merciless chaos.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Despite no one listening to his constant earlier pleads and everyone labelling
                                        him as a delusional buffoon, Sherif agreed and started packing his things.
                                        It was expected. He has the genes of the pharaohs. He can’t just leave his
                                        beloved country behind.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He took the next available plane home and was greeted by the chief Egyptologist
                                        at the airport. Sherif didn’t waste a single minute and started asking
                                        questions. He wanted to catch up with all the events that happened. Really what
                                        Sherif wanted to know was how in million years he, a mere Egyptologist, could
                                        possibly end this chaos.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Sherif asked the chief: “Why did you specifically call me?” <br>
                                        Chief: “Everything in your report made sense. Everything you mention happened
                                        and at this point, the president authorized me to fully support your decisions.
                                        Sherif, my son, I know we put you down but please, please, I beg you to not take
                                        out your anger on Egypt.” <br>
                                        Sherif assured the chief that he would never do that and started brainstorming
                                        solutions right away. <br>
                                        Sherif: “By any chance, did you move Raa’s body back to the burial chambers in
                                        Saqqara?”<br>
                                        Chief: “Yes, we did but sadly nothing changed.”<br>
                                        Sherif: “Oh God... Bu-Bu-But… Th-Thi-This should’ve done it.”<br>
                                        Chief: “Take a couple of days to think about this. Please, please do your
                                        magic.”<br>
                                        Sherif: “Alright.” <br>
                                    </p>

                                        On a dark, cold, and gloomy night, while staring at the chaos happening on the
                                        streets, Sherif asked himself, What does “glorious home” mean? Is it just the
                                        place where you sleep? But then he remembered that it didn’t feel like home when
                                        he ran away and travelled, leaving his family and his loved ones behind.
                                        Then a thought popped in his head. Was Raa buried alone? He made some phone
                                        calls, and it turns out, he was right. Raa was asleep next to his beloved wife,
                                        Hatshepsut. Hatshepsut, Queen of the Nile and Raa’s one and only wife, was
                                        buried 3 meters away in a hidden room. Her body was moved to a different museum
                                        due to some bureaucratic bulls***.

                                        Sherif sat for a couple of hours, trying to make sense of all this new
                                        information. After what seemed like a decade, he jumped out of his chair and
                                        called the chief.

                                        Sherif: “You idiots, his home is not the temple. His home is Queen Hatshepsut.
                                        There is no home without your loved ones. Raa loved his wife so much that he
                                        wanted to spend his entire life with her. Even after his death.
                                        Their curse is- I mean, their love is so strong that it is not just causing the
                                        chaos, but is going to soon destroy Egypt. <br>
                                        For once trust me you degene****. Listen to me. Move the queen to the arms of
                                        her beloved. Once they feel each other’s presence, the chaos will stop, and
                                        Egypt will live to see another day.”
